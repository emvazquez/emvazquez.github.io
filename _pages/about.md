About me
======

I am a researcher in the domain of Bayesian Design and Analysis of [Computer Experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_experiment).

Teaching
======

I am a professor of Bayesian statistics at CentraleSup√©lec. I am also coordinator of data science projects. In the past I have also taught functional analysis and probability theory.

You can learn more about data science projects in the teaching tab above.

Research
======

The field of design and analysis of computer experiments consists in using statistical approaches to problems such as  approximation, uncertainty quantification, optimization, etc. involving computer programs (or simulators) that emulate physical systems (see, e.g., Santner 2003).

My work relies on the Bayesian sequential decision theory.  In the domain of computer experiments, the Bayesian approach starts with a prior distribution that represents our prior belief about the structure of the computer model. The use of this approach  for computer experiments appeared in the 1980s (see the seminal article by [Sacks et al. (1989)](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1177012413).

I am currently involved in the stirring commitees of the [GdR MascotNum](http://www.gdr-mascotnum.fr) and the [PGMO program](https://www.fondation-hadamard.fr/PGMO) of the FMJH.
