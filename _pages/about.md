About me
======

I am a researcher in the domain of Bayesian Design and Analysis of [Computer Experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_experiment).

Teaching
======

I teach Bayesian statistics at CentraleSup√©lec. I am also coordinator of data science projects. In the past I have also taught functional analysis and probability theory.

Research
======

_Design and analysis of computer experiments_ is about using statistical approaches to problems such as  approximation, uncertainty quantification, optimization... involving computer programs (or simulators) that emulate physical systems (see, e.g., [Santner 2003](https://www.springer.com/fr/book/9780387954202)).

My work relies on the theory of Bayesian sequential decision.  In the domain of computer experiments, the Bayesian approach starts with a prior distribution that represents our prior belief about the structure of the computer model. The use of this approach  for computer experiments appeared in the 1980s (see the seminal article by [Sacks et al. 1989](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1177012413)).

My activities are reflected in my current implication in the stirring commitees of the [GdR MascotNum](http://www.gdr-mascotnum.fr) and the [PGMO program](https://www.fondation-hadamard.fr/PGMO) of the FMJH.

Software
======
I am co-author of the [Matlab/GNU Octave STK](https://sourceforge.net/projects/kriging/) (the small toolbox for kriging), with my colleague Julien Bect being the main developper now. This toolbox is about Gaussian processes for computer experiments.
